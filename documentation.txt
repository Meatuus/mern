1) create-react-app name-of-app
2) cd src && rm App.css App.js App.test.js favicon.ico index.css logo.svg
3) remove require's importing these deleted files in index.html and index.js
4) create new components and render new component in index.js
5) npm i axios express body-parser foreman nodemon marked mongoose --save
    - Axios: let us use HTTP methods to communicate with our database.
    - Express: provide a framework to set up our Node.js server.
    - Body Parser: parse the incoming requests bodies for the info we are sending (gives us access to `req.body` which we will be using soon).
    - Foreman: allows us to boot up our API and webpack-dev-server simultaneously.
    - Nodemon: watches our server.js file for changes, then restarts it.
    - Marked: to convert markdown syntax to html. I used this in place of Remarkable (which the FB tutorial uses)
    - Mongoose: abstracts away the MongoDB boilerplate for a simple Schema solution.
6) create server.js in root



- .gitignore
- data.js
- index.html
- package.json
- README.md
- server.js
