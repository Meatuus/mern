1) create-react-app name-of-app
2) cd src && rm App.css App.js App.test.js favicon.ico index.css logo.svg
3) remove require's importing these deleted files in index.html and index.js
4) create new components and render new component in index.js
5) npm i axios express body-parser foreman nodemon marked mongoose --save
    - Axios: let us use HTTP methods to communicate with our database.
    - Express: provide a framework to set up our Node.js server.
    - Body Parser: parse the incoming requests bodies for the info we are sending (gives us access to `req.body` which we will be using soon).
    - Foreman: allows us to boot up our API and webpack-dev-server simultaneously.
    - Nodemon: watches our server.js file for changes, then restarts it.
    - Marked: to convert markdown syntax to html. I used this in place of Remarkable (which the FB tutorial uses)
    - Mongoose: abstracts away the MongoDB boilerplate for a simple Schema solution.
6) create server.js in root
7) integrate db in server.js file (eg mLabs)
8) create schema - here it's model/comments.js
9) require schema in server.js
10) add Procfile in root
11) add “start”: “react-scripts start”, “start-dev”: “nf start -p 3000”, to package.json
12) run npm run start-dev to run both api and react app
13) add GET and POST, etc to server.js file
14) can test with postman by doing get and post requests through postman
15) add api url to index.js render call
